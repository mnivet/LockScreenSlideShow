# LockScreenSlideShow

A simple tool to make windows 10 lock screen act like I desire.  
*very personal taste*

## Pain

Windows 10 Lockscreen personalization allow to define a slideshow, however this one is cluncky:  

* Impossible to define duration between images.
* Take the liberty to print multiple images on one screen with some animations.  
  *Some may think it's cool, but me not, and it's not configurable.*
* It do not affect the picture of the user selection screen.

## Solution

Write my own little script to define the current image, and schedule it with the desired periodicity.
